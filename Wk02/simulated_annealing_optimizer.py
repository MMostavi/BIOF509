    """Calculate the best path between multiple points using a simulated annealing algorithm

    The simulated annealing algorithm begins with a given path and calculates its cost.
    Each iteration generates a new path with two random consecutive points switched.
    If the new path has a lower cost, it is better and will replace the current path.
    If it has a higher cost, it is a worse path and may replace the current path, as
    decided by comparing a random number with an acceptance probability that depends on
    the temperature. The temperature decreases a bit in each iteration, giving worse paths
    a lesser chance of replacing the current path. Allowing worse paths at the beginning
    helps to avoid converging to a local minimum rather than the global minimum.
